    I want it to be longer, and for some of the weird stuff I have at the very end to be integrated better. Right now I like the rhythm.

A soft light strikes the wall,<br>
across the bed, a woman sprawled.<br>
Rippling flesh and tender touch,<br>
there's nothing here designed to fuck.<br><br>

Black stilettos and underwear.<br>
Nothing more, her skin is bare.<br>
A curtain blocks the eyes below,<br>
but you and I peek through the holes.<br><br>

A shadow cast, a sudden glance.<br>
The ripples stop, there's no more dance.<br>
Whoever was there has left their place<br>
And what remains can't claim a face.<br><br>

(Repetition here to lead into something similar to below)<br><br>

Something harder now,<br>
nothing soft in the<br><br>

Muscles tighten and sinew strains against the taught plastic skin.<br>
We could trace out her organs, no medical student could outdo our intimate knowledge.<br>
I'll play John, you play George. Of course, name's don't matter.<br>
But what fun is an act without a character?<br><br>

This is a poem that is trying to investigate the somewhat performative nature of sexuality. I also want to get at some grotesque parts of sexuality, as well as something violent and carnal. It's all very nebulous right now.
