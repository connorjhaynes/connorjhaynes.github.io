<h2>2025 New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions</h2>

<p>The more I think about it the more I am convinced that most of these resolutions are really just re-discovering the lessons one might learn in third grade.</p>

<h3>1. Schedule</h3>

<p>I remember how useful and helpful a daily schedule was when I was at Auburn. I&rsquo;d like to return to that, with a strong focus on dedicating time to <em>think</em>. Think about math, about reading, about writing, about whatever. Mostly math though.</p>

<p>I think that part of this, an essential part, is setting goals (on both a long- and short-term time scale). Thoughtfully setting and describing goals is something I have never done naturally, but it seems almost self-evident that this behavior would be helpful in making goals more attainable and present in the mind.</p>

<h3>2. Think</h3>

<p>A consistent trend in my resting mind recently has been the presence of thoughts about thinking. One thing I took away from Professor Chongchun Zheng&rsquo;s proofs class was the idea that &ldquo;most people do not think.&rdquo; At least for me, this seems true. I have a hard time actually sitting down and just thinking. This is something I&rsquo;d like to get better at. Intelligence and thoughtfulness are virtues that are core to my personal philosophy of society, progress, humanity, etc. and so cultivating them seems only right.</p>

<h3>3. Meditate</h3>

<p>This year I&rsquo;d like to engage with more spiritual, ritualistic behaviors. I&rsquo;ve been reading the Dao Teh Ching recently and I&rsquo;d like to learn and practice Daoist meditation techniques. From my limited reading it seems that meditation is, at the very least, not worth discrediting as a method by which I might make myself more &ldquo;well&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m also interested in cultivating a certain air of decisive peace which I have so far found only in the minutes before exams.</p>

<h3>4. Cook</h3>

<p>This one is a bit misleading. I&rsquo;d like to generally be healthier, and cooking seems a convenient way to get there. In addition to being more intentional about training for climbing and slacklining, I&rsquo;d like to return to my meal-prepping routine. I really enjoyed those meals, and it was way more convenient than eating out (and also cheaper).</p>

<h3>5. Read</h3>

<p>This kind of resolution is probably one of the most typical. I&rsquo;d like to spend more time this year reading. Not from any one particular source, although mathematical, existentialist, and Daoist texts are at the top of my list currently. I&rsquo;d also like to think more critically about what I am reading. I&rsquo;ve fallen out of touch with literary analysis, and although I have no claims to any skill in the area I do enjoy thinking about what I&rsquo;m reading.</p>

<h3>6. Write</h3>

<p>I really value my ability to write, and I&rsquo;d like to hone that skill. I think that I could be much better at writing things like grant and REU applications. That style of direct, no fuss writing is not something that comes naturally to me, as you might be able to tell from the writing here. Another thing I&rsquo;d like to improve is my mathematical writing. I usually feel rather confident in the supposition that my writing is clear and thorough, but I am sure that my writing can be improved (and I hope that along with better writing comes better math, although I can see no reason why that would be the case).</p>

<h3>7. Understand</h3>

<p>Recently I was introduced to director Steven Soderbergh&rsquo;s <em>EXT765</em> via an article he had written on how he studies blocking. In the article he discussed how he had resolved to study Spielberg&rsquo;s blocking. To do so, he downloaded a copy of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> and made it black and white, in addition to replacing the sound with the score to <em>The Social Network</em>. This was all to remove distractions and allow his mind to solely focus on the blocking of the movie.</p>

<p>I wonder if there do not exist similar techniques or mindsets that might allow me to gain a deeper understanding of proofs. I find it hard to derive meaningful information from just reading a proof, and so I&rsquo;d like to spend time meaningfully interrogating the ways in which things are proven. I don&rsquo;t know where this might start, if it should happen on a per-author basis, or based on the subject material, but I&rsquo;d like to look into it. Something to schedule, perhaps.</p>
