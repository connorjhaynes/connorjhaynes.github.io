<p>Unfortunately I, in my urgency to do nothing at all, deleted my last notes file. This is frustrating. Regardless, we will begin again.</p>

<h3>Coffee</h3>

<p>I have just purchased my first container of Cafe Bustello Instant Espresso. I realized that I was spending far too much money on coffee from Dunkin' Donuts, and so my solution was to purchase some instant coffee. I was tempted while shopping to purchase a cofee machine, which was only twenty-two dollars (in my mind quite a steal), but I decided against it in hopes of keeping the table I use for my drink preparation tidy.</p>

<p>The coffee itself has a chocolate aroma before prepared. My first cup was, in my estimation, made with too much water. My second cup, which I am drinking as I write this, is stronger but still muddled. I filled the cup halfway (with respect to height not volume, maybe ). I think that drinking this coffee will become an enjoyable morning routine. The taste is pleasantly understated, with much of the flavor present in the rear of my tongue.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>

<p>I have been making a consistent effort for some days now to move, speak, and write in a way that is in the spirit of Gus Van Sant&rsquo;s <em>Do Easy</em>. Of course the curious reader might ask, &ldquo;What spirit, precisely, do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, the answer lies in the question. The point of <em>Do Easy</em>, or the &ldquo;rule of D.E.&rdquo; as Van Sant might call it, is <em>simplicity through precision</em>. This means living life in a way that does not impeed your own living. When a cup is set down and a clatter arises, place it again so that it does no such thing. When walking through a room, if your toe catches a stray chair that has jumped into your path, begin your journey again with new eyes and note the precise path via which you may pass unharmed.</p>

<p>In my estimation this comes down to the maxim &ldquo;do it right or do it again.&rdquo; In my writing I have been particularly pleased with the results of D.E. I find that my thoughts are clearer, and I am measures more proud of my thoughts themselves.</p>

<h3>Shower Performance</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea for a piece of performance art that came to me while in the shower last night. I was washing myself and I realized that I naturally struck poses not dissimilar from those a body-builder might strike. This inspired me to conceive of some short piece of performance art wherein the performer showers, and as he or she showers strikes these similar hypermasculine and (maybe) hyperfeminine poses. The idea is that the performer is actually performing for the shower head, which itself casts down scalding water upon their body. I&rsquo;d like the performer&rsquo;s actions to somehow convey a story.</p>

<h3>Tattoo Idea</h3>

<p>A number of days ago I was able to dream up what is, ostensibly, something of an original and interesting tattoo design. The design itself would consist of many hands all encircling the neck of the wearer. These hands would be rendered photorealistically and in various states of age, gender, race, repair, and disrepair.</p>

<p>Depending on the placement of the tattoo, the wearer could present as if there were some constant mass of men and women under their clothing grasping up and outwards.</p>

<h3>Lo-Fi Notification System</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to have a small, thin, wallet-sized device that handles notifications for me. This would replace my phone in my pocket for when I&rsquo;m working. I&rsquo;m thinking that I would like it to be reminiscent of mid- twentieth-century Braun in terms of design. In my mind the most prominent characteristic is that I would like all information communicated via a split-flap display. Here&rsquo;s a loose idea of how I&rsquo;d like it to operate:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Device listens via cellular to network for notifications</p></li>
<li><p>Once a notification is delivered, the device may emit a noise or vibrate to alert the user to the presence of a notification</p></li>
<li><p>Once the user is ready to receive the notification, a button on the side of the device is pressed and the notification is displayed with relevant information like source, time, etc.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I think I&rsquo;d like a creme color for the encasement. For the buttons, I&rsquo;d like something highly tactile. The most prominent button, the one that actually displays the information, will be red and feel/look like a cassette recorder button.</p>

<p>I think a Raspberry PiW is what would be best for this. I&rsquo;d like to write the code in C or Go. I&rsquo;d like the PiW to run FreeBSD, and I think that I will 3D print the case, although I&rsquo;d much prefer to mill or CNC some acrylic/acetate.</p>

<p>I think a MVP should at least capture email and SMS messages. I&rsquo;m sure that there are email protocols (POP, IMAP maybe?) that can handle email notifications. SMS might be more difficult. I am also unsure how to handle connectivity for the device. It is probably easiest to just piggyback it off of my phone, since that will be around all the time.</p>

<p>Miniaturizing the split-flap displays might be difficult. At least 36 characters per position means the device might have to be thick. Maybe there are better display options. Perhaps just a cylinder with the symbols painted on? There are always just LED displays, which are going to be more flexible and useful if I&rsquo;m being honest.</p>
