<p>Unfortunately I, in my urgency to do nothing at all, deleted my last notes file. This is frustrating. Regardless, we will begin again.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>

<p>I have been making a consistent effort for some days now to move, speak, and write in a way that is in the spirit of Gus Van Sant&rsquo;s <em>Do Easy</em>. Of course the curious reader might ask, &ldquo;What spirit, precisely, do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My interprestation is that the point of <em>Do Easy</em>, or the &ldquo;rule of D.E.&rdquo; as Van Sant might call it, is <em>simplicity through precision</em>. This means living life in a way that does not impede your own living. When a cup is set down and a clatter arises, place it again so that it does no such thing. When walking through a room, if your toe catches a stray chair that has jumped into your path, begin your journey again with new eyes and note the precise path via which you may pass unharmed.</p>

<p>In my estimation this comes down to the maxim &ldquo;do it right or do it again.&rdquo; In my writing I have been particularly pleased with the results of D.E. I find that my thoughts are clearer, and I am measures more proud of my thoughts themselves.</p>

<h3>Lo-Fi Notification System</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to have a small, thin, wallet-sized device that handles notifications for me. This would replace my phone in my pocket for when I&rsquo;m working. I&rsquo;m thinking that I would like it to be reminiscent of mid- twentieth-century Braun in terms of design. In my mind the most prominent characteristic is that I would like all information communicated via a split-flap display. Here&rsquo;s a loose idea of how I&rsquo;d like it to operate:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Device listens via cellular to network for notifications</p></li>
<li><p>Once a notification is delivered, the device may emit a noise or vibrate to alert the user to the presence of a notification</p></li>
<li><p>Once the user is ready to receive the notification, a button on the side of the device is pressed and the notification is displayed with relevant information like source, time, etc.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I think I&rsquo;d like a creme color for the case. For the buttons, I&rsquo;d like something highly tactile. The most prominent button, the one that actually displays the information, will be red and feel/look like a cassette recorder button.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what is best for this, but I think that a PiW would be good. I&rsquo;d like to write the code in C or Go. I&rsquo;d like the PiW to run FreeBSD, and I think that I will 3D print the case, although I&rsquo;d much prefer to mill or CNC some acrylic/acetate.</p>

<p>I think a MVP should at least capture email and SMS messages. I&rsquo;m sure that there are email protocols (POP, IMAP) that can handle email notifications. SMS might be more difficult. I am also unsure how to handle connectivity for the device. It is probably easiest to just piggyback it off of my phone, since that will be around all the time.</p>

<p>Miniaturizing the split-flap displays might be difficult. At least 36 characters per position means the device might have to be thick. Maybe there are better display options. Perhaps just a cylinder with the symbols painted on? There are always just LED displays, which are going to be more flexible and useful if I&rsquo;m being honest.</p>

<h3>Miss Ogilvy Finds Herself</h3>

<p>This short story from Radclyffe Hall tells a fantastic tale regarding one Miss Ogilvy, a woman who in her fifties joins the French military and leads a nurse&rsquo;s unit on the front lines of what I presume is World War I/II. The story recounts in short order her childhood as an awkwardly masculine woman in a rather oppressive world. Although not explicitly lesbian, Miss Ogilvy is what we would likely call &ldquo;butch&rdquo; or a &ldquo;tomboy&rdquo; in modern parlence. The story concludes with Miss Ogilvy&rsquo;s visit to a small, unknown island where she experiences a fantastic dream and subsequently passes away.</p>

<p>I read this short story in <em>The Persistent Desire: A Femme-Butch Reader</em>, which is a collection of short stories, essays, and interviews intended on documenting and communicating the history and lives of femme and butch lesbians in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>I want to write more here about this, but I forgot to. Maybe another day.</p>

<h3>Back on the Chain Gang</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling a lot of anxiety about school starting tomorrow. My issues with registering for Algebraic Topology persist. I only got home from my game night at around 23:15, which was certainly not a good start for things. I find myself worrying about this a lot, because I know how easy it is for me to slip into easy but harmful behaviors, so I want to ensure that I am always starting with my best foot forward. Here&rsquo;s to hoping that this stumble wasn&rsquo;t off a cliff.</p>

<h3>Two Jokes</h3>

<p>Two engineers have been tasked with measuring a flagpole. They try for hours, but because they are engineers they cannot climb it. They resolve to use its shadow and basic trigonometry, but the day is cloudy. The engineers are sitting dejectedly when a mathematician comes along and inquires as to their woes. They explain their dilemma, and after a moment of thinking the mathematician digs up the flag pole, measures its length, and then sets off. The engineers still sit dejectedly, one complaining &ldquo;These mathematicians are useless, they cannot apply anything they know! I asked for the height of the flagpole and he gave me the length!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A mathematician has decided to become a firefighter. As part of her training she is presented with a burning building and a hose, and asked what to do. The mathematician of course says that she will use the hose to extinguish the fire. Next the mathematician is presented with a building that is not on fire and a hose. When asked what to do, the mathematician stands and thinks for a moment before declaring that she will set the building on fire. When asked why, she responds &ldquo;Now I have reduced the problem to one whose solution is already known!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>T-Shirts</h3>

<p> Here are some ideas for T-shirt designs. I'd like to just print these things on a simple white shirt.</p>

I spent many years thinking people from families like his got better treatment than me. Now I realize the truth: The beast is so monstrous it will devour us all." - weev<br>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>Today I worked for a little over three hours, which is probably more like four given that I forgot to time some of my work this morning. I slept in, waking around 9:40 and getting to work around 11:00. I had a breakfast sandwich composed of two veggie sausage patties, a stale english muffin, and a slice of cheddar cheese. I also had my normal coffee, and a cup of applesauce. I worked on probability theory homework until around 1, at which point I went with Macy to climb. We climbed for about an hour, nothing intense.</p>

<p>Afterwards we had boba and I went to the grocer to purchase some food. I got back around 16:00, did some work on the homework, then ate dinner around 17:00. I had some broccoli, mac and cheese with spinach, and four veggie chicken nuggets I had prepared the night before. I also had another cup of coffee and a cup of pears.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the meal. It felt uncomplicated, but not simple, as I told Macy. Then I got back to work around 18:00 and started the laundry. It&rsquo;s now 22:20, which means that I am a bit behind on starting my shower. The homework is not done, but there remains only one problem. I will have to rush a bit to finish my homework for combinatorial analysis, due Friday, which is a bit worrisome.</p>

<p>I want to write a song about The Stranger, particularly Meursault&rsquo;s time in prison and, of course, the murder. I recall feeling vividly oppressed when reading about his time on the beach. Who knows where that will go, if anywhere.</p>

<h3>The Persistent Desire</h3>

<p>I also spent some time (~40 minutes in my recollection) reading <em>The Persistent Desire</em>.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s sections covered an oral history from the Lesbian Herstory Archives of the gay scene in Manhattan. Apparently, early butch and femme subcultures were in some sense nurtured by the mob&rsquo;s investment in clubs. The entry discusses the practices of hiring butches and drag queens to perform their typical dances, and notes that many butches would often find themselves presented with a gaggle of &ldquo;straight&rdquo; and &ldquo;inverted&rdquo; women. Indeed, many powerful women engaged in lesbianism as well (&ldquo;men are for business, women are for pleasure&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Orthogonal to this, the echoes of these mob influences persist today. The entry details an (anonymized) conversation between the author and an older butch who is afraid to detail their adventures for fear of violence by the owners of clubs. Indeed the lesbian history was, for a long time, a purely oral one, passed down through photo albums and the stories that go along with each 8 by 10.</p>

<p>From this reading came the strong sense that in this time, to be a lesbian was truly to be a &ldquo;sister.&rdquo; Raised in a time when your sexuality was illegal, lesbians learned to accept those who were in trouble without a second thought, and the writer notes that &ldquo;they were used to pulling one another out of scrapes (it came with the territory)&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know that these notes are only for my own eyes, but I should be clear that I am not writing as if any of this is true for all women, or all lesbians. This is just my loose, poorly written, vague recollection of the writing and what it said to me.</p>

<p>There was also a poem that I enjoyed (<em>Of Althea and Flaxie</em>). I don&rsquo;t know how to judge it, I lack poetic taste at this moment.</p>

<p>And now it&rsquo;s 22:46, so I&rsquo;ve really fucked myself!</p>

<h3> Efficiency </h3>
I wish I had been more explicit about how to work in my resolutions. I seem to have forgotten my tendency to frontload and then get screwed on the back end of assignments. What I need is a slow, steady pace. Something like one problem per homework assignment per day. This might give me more time during the week to read other things as well, which would be great. I'm glad I have the planner set up for this kind of thing though, so I think I'll be able to integrate this knowledge quickly.
