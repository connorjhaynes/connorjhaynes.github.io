I know that this man is bad. <br>
I know that this man is evil. <br>
I know that this man knows hate, <br>
hate like I will never know. <br>
I know that this man can't tell. <br>
I know that this man can't see <br>
the damage he does. <br><br>

But there's something in his eyes. <br>
That dead stare toward the mound. <br>
That strength in his brow. <br>
The ripple of his muscled frame, <br>
catapulting a missile down the center-line. <br>

I can see his eyes bulge as he releases. <br>
I can see his face breaking, <br>
his lungs emptied. <br>
I can see his mouth opened wide. <br>
I sense his scream far before I hear it. <br><br>

We share something. <br>
We share those dead eyes. <br>
We share that silent scream. <br>
