<h2> Work in progress </h2>

I'm starting to get baseball.<br><br>
There was a time when I sat next to southern gentlemen and heard them scream, heard them shout at the box. I didn't understand why they cared so much.<br><br>
John Rocker is a bad person, but I get it. He's one of them, he's a twentieth-century man. He was beaten. He watched God drink his way into a stupor.<br><br>

But there's something in his eyes. <br>
That dead stare toward the mound. <br>
That strength in his brow. <br>
The ripple of his muscled frame, <br>
catapulting a missile down the center-line. <br><br>

I can see his eyes bulge as he releases. <br>
I can see his face breaking, <br>
his lungs emptied. <br>
I can see his mouth opened wide. <br>
I sense his scream far before I hear it. <br><br>

We share something. <br>
We share those dead eyes. <br>
We share that silent scream. <br>
We share those broad shoulders, <br>
shoulders that could bear the weight of the world. <br>
And bear it they did.
