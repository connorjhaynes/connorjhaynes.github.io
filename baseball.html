<h2> Work in progress </h2>

I'm starting to get baseball.<br><br>
There was a time when I sat next to southern gentlemen and heard them scream, heard them shout at the box. I didn't understand why they cared so much.<br><br>
John Rocker is a bad person, but I get it. He's one of them, he's a twentieth-century man. He was beaten. He watched God drink his way into a stupor.<br><br>

There's something in my eyes. <br>
A dead stare toward the mound. <br>
Some strength in my brow. <br>
A ripple in my muscled frame, <br>
catapulting a missile down the center-line. <br><br>

My eyes bulge as I release. <br>
My face breaks and my lungs empty. <br>
I gasp for air, my mouth agape. <br>
I feel my scream far before I hear it. <br><br>

We share something, my dad and I. <br>
We share those dead eyes. <br>
We share that silent scream. <br>
We share those broad shoulders, <br>
shoulders they told me would bear the weight of the world. <br>
And bear it they did.
