	  I absolutely <b>love</b> music. Music has had a strong presence throughout my life. The power of music to induce emotional and spiritual states is, for me, possibly the greatest privilege that comes with life. <br> <br>

	  I can remember when I realized this. I was in high school, I think freshman or sophomore year. I was sitting on my bed, listening to music. I can't recall the song or artist, but those details are insignificant. As I was listening, there was a presence that joined me. I can only describe it as comforting. It felt like there was someone else in the room, some grand visitor that was viewing me, and empowering me to see myself from that new perspective. <br> <br>

	  I think that in a lot of ways I have been chasing that experience for a long time. Whatever it was, I can only describe it as religious. It instilled in me a new appreciation for emotion and experience. Moreover, it provided me a new lense with which to examine life, that of the <i> observer </i>. This concept is still loose in my mind, but maybe it is best communicated as <br> <br>

	    "the essence of all people and things that watch, that see, and by doing so fundamentally alter." <br> <br>

	  </center>

	  I know, a bit cringy, but if that concession is not enough, fuck you. This is a place of sincerity. That's all for now.
